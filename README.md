Help your survivors grow up big and strong!
An uncommon item that increases survivor size by 50% per stack while also slightly increasing health, damage, speed, and jump height.

To install manually, drop the SpaceSpinach.dll file into your BepInEx plugins folder. 
Commonly found here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins

### Known Issues:
 - At higher stacks of the item the player's walk cycle speeds up too much for their size.
 - The item shows up as a white box in the command menu rather than properly displaying it's icon.
 - Ranged characters have a harder time hitting enemies near their feet at higher stacks of the item due to camera scaling.
