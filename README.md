## Changelog:
### - 1.0.1
  - Improved performance
  - Improved consistancy of tracking stats between levels

## Known Issues:
Major:
 - Quitting to menu/dying results in the camera position not reseting to normal for that character. For now this can be fixed by restarting the game.

Minor: 
 - Player walk cycles do not scale well with size, often being much too fast.
 - The item shows up as a white box in the artifact of command menu.
 - Ranged characters have a harder time hitting enemies near their feet at higher stacks of the item due to camera position scaling.
